js is programming-language...
1> high level, 
2> single threaded, 
3> garbage collected, 
4> jit compiled(!), 
5> proto-type based, 
6> multi - paradigm
7> dynamic
8> programming-language with a non blocking event loop.

// a lookup to the time complexities
O(1) - Constant: The runtime is independent of the input size.

O(log n) - Logarithmic: The runtime grows logarithmically with the input size (e.g., binary search).

O(n) - Linear: The runtime grows linearly with the input size (e.g., searching an unsorted array).

O(n log n) - Linearithmic: A combination of linear and logarithmic growth (efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort).

O(nÂ²) - Quadratic: The runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size (e.g., nested loops over the entire input).
